### NeRF + Adversarial Framework  
Treat NeRF like a Generator, but also include shape and appearance code.  
The generator is trained in an adversarial framework, where the discriminator looks at given multi-scale patches.  
Efficiently trains for higher fidelity (resolution) and can disentangle shape and appearance.
