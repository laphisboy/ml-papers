#### NeRF + Shape/Texture Code + Camera Pose Optimization  
Optimizes model and both shape and texture code during training across observed objects,  
Optimizes camera pose during inference  
Able to control shape, texture, camera pose during image synthesis  
Can use trained model on single input image with unknown camera pose (figure right)

#### Keywords: Single View Reconstruction, Shape and Texture Disentanglement, Camera Pose Optimization, Scene Prior
